## Developing for Mixed Reality

We created a minimum [HelloWorld Unity project](https://github.com/EricVoll/MRTK_HelloWorld) including MRTK 3 (preview version) for you to clone and use as a starting point for your project. The sample scene contains a MRTK 3 Rig (which offers all sorts of hand-tracking/interaction for different platforms (HL2, SmartPhones etc.) and an example cube, which rests on a plane. If you click the "play" button in Unity, you can hold down the Space bar to simulate HL2's hand tracking. By moving the mouse and clicking, you can drag the cube around or resize it by grabbing the bounds. You can find more information (links etc.) in the repository's ReadMe.

For a far more involved Unity project, which we definitely suggest you to check out, visit the [ZappysPlayground](https://github.com/microsoft/ZappysPlayground) repository, clone it, and open the Unity project. It shows many features of MRTK 3, together with Azure Spatial Anchors and many, many more features. While that project is great for inspiration, we don't suggest using it as a starting point, because it is very large/bloated already.
