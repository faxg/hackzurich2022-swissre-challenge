<PageDescription>

Extended Reality technologies help to simulate dangerous real-world
situations. They add new perspectives on risk and can convey the consequences
of natural catastrophes in first person. We challenge you to utilise them for
a disaster simulation.

## Raise risk awareness through Extended Reality

Climate change poses one of the most pervasive risks to our planet.
Society needs to be better prepared for natural catastrophes.
At Swiss Re, we make the world more resilient, helping communities and businesses to prepare for and mitigate the consequences of disasters.
We innovate with new solutions and utilise emerging tech to identify and prevent the toughest risks across the globe.
In this challenge, we focus on leveraging Extended Reality technologies such as Virtual, Augmented or Mixed Reality.
The aim is to raise awareness and increase resilience for natural catastrophes such as floods.
The solution can contain but is not limited to simulations of flood scenarios from indoor point of view
and/or on existing facilities.
You can decide to work with the latest Mixed Reality hardware or utilise smartphones;
augment existing Swiss Re solutions or work on your own idea that is related to the challenge.
Our engineers and our challenge partner Microsoft will coach you in this journey.

Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR) technologies are powerful in simulating costly or dangerous real-world situations. They can help us to create new perspectives on risk or to convey the consequences of natural catastrophes in first person. We challenge you to create a natural catastrophe (e.g., flood) simulation utilising Extended Reality technologies.

Climate change poses one of the most pervasive risks to our planet. Swiss Re makes the world more resilient, helping communities and businesses to recover quickly after a disaster. We strive to mitigate the impact of natural catastrophes such as flood and thus save lives. In the Risk Engineering Services team, we work in new and innovative ways to identify and prevent the toughest risks across the globe, and we see great potential in applying emerging technologies to achieve this. For this challenge, we focus on solutions that leverage Extended Reality technology to raise awareness and increase resilience for natural catastrophes such as extreme weather events and floods. The solution can contain but is not limited to

- VR/AR: Simulation of flood scenarios from an indoor point of view
- AR: Simulation of a flood scenario in a real-world use case (e.g., existing facility)
- AR: Smartphone-based app that has access to elevation data that visualizes impact of a flood events and provides assistance such as escape routes (similar to Google Maps AR)
- VR: Awareness raising through catastrophe scenarios (e.g., a natural or man-made catastrophe in a subway station, live concert, example, example)

If you want to address additional challenges in your solution, think about adding metrics and damage estimation based on different flood levels, Gamification Elements and ways to scale/promote this application (e.g. as open source) for different stakeholders such as companies, municipalities, NGOs or citizens (private users).
