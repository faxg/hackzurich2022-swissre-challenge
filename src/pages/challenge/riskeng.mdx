    Hi, I am Youssef, Risk engineer at SwissRe. Originally from Morocco, I am
    now based in Paris. My biggest fear was to stop learning, then I joined
    SwissRe : the most dynamic innovators and challenging insurance company.
    Today, I am a mechanical engineer, attending the Hackzurich and working on
    AI projects

    "borders are great - they really energize me when I step over them!"

  <p>
    I am Philip, a risk engineer, senior leader and innovator. I joined Swiss Re
    10 years ago and built-up our EMEA team of risk engineers, the most diverse,
    talented and fun group of people I have ever worked with. I am fascinated by
    people, especially young talents and by solving our customers' problems, by
    first understanding them and helping build a proper problem statement. I am
    fascinated, even after 10 years as Swiss Re's mission to make the world more
    resilient gives me true purpose, a challenging environment to grow and learn
    new things and enable others to grow. The direct access to the Corporate
    world and today's speed of transformation provide an abundance of
    opportunities to choose from. @RISKEngineering, we help create value beyond
    risk transfer.

  <p>Meet Philip at the HackZurich onsite!</p>
