## Azure Fundamentals

Not too familiar with <span>Microsoft Azure Cloud</span>?
Here's how to get started with free learning paths.

- [AZ 900 - Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900?tab=tab-learning-paths)
- [AI 900 - Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)

- [Azure Mixed Reality Cloud Services Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/mixed-reality-cloud-services)

  Azure Cloud provides some useful services for MR applications, such as
  [Azure Remote Rendering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/remote-rendering/), [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spatial-anchors/)
  and [Azure Object Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/object-anchors/).

## Microsoft Mixed Reality

Start here to learn the basic concepts and terminology, and how to pick a tech stack for Mixed Reality Development.
